            <h2>Introduction to Sridharacharya</h2>
            <img src="image/srid.jpg" alt="Sridharacharya's portrait">
            <p>Sridharacharya, also known as Sridharacharya, was an ancient Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to algebra, particularly in the solving of quadratic equations. His work laid the foundation for future developments in mathematics in India and the world.</p>
            <p>He is best known for formulating the "Sridharacharya's formula" for solving quadratic equations, which became a crucial aspect of algebraic solutions.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <img src="image/ancien.jpg" alt="Map of Ancient India">
            <p>Though details about Sridharacharya's life are sparse, it is believed that he was born in the region that is now Tamil Nadu, India. During his time, India had a rich tradition of learning, and he was likely trained in both religious and scientific subjects, including mathematics and astronomy.</p>
            <p>Like many ancient Indian scholars, Sridharacharya would have studied under renowned teachers in a traditional guru-shishya system, gaining knowledge from texts such as the Vedas and other mathematical works.</p>

            <h2>Key Mathematical Contributions</h2>
            <img src="image/quad.jpg" alt="Quadratic Equation Diagram">
            <p>Sridharacharya is most famous for his work on solving quadratic equations. His formula for solving quadratic equations of the form:</p>
            <p><strong>ax² + bx + c = 0</strong></p>
            <p>He derived the formula:</p>
            <p><strong>x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a</strong></p>
            <p>This solution, known as the quadratic formula, has been foundational in algebra and remains in use to this day. His work was essential in advancing the understanding of algebraic equations in Indian mathematics.</p>
